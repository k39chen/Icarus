Hello all!

Welcome to the Icarus repository :).

Icarus is a helicopter-type game where you avoid flying too high into the sky or falling into the sea.

To quickly try out this game, just download the 'latest/' directory and start up the 'demo.html'.

This is an ongoing project and will be my first Java game :D.

Cheers.
