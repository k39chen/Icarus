Hello all!

Welcome to the Icarus repository :).

Icarus is an auto-scrolling runner where you avoid fun flying obstacles and go for the high score!

To quickly try out this game, just download the 'latest/' directory and start up the 'demo.html'.

This is an ongoing project and will be my first Java game :D.

Cheers.
